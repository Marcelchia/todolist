## What did you like about this project?
Managed to copy and solve most errors in most pages, while trying to figure out different function
copied the javascript and css accordingly, altering values.

## What did you struggle with in this project?
I feel i do not understand Springboot at all
I am not able render out the values as there are errors which i am not able to catch,
I struggled the most for this out of all the other assessment =.=

## What would make your experience with this assessment better?
Springboot is really hard, if you could stretch this abit longer to explain in detail 
it would be better, I tried to study it over the weekend but i still dont really understand 
each functions well and why they link up the way they do.
