# todolist

## What did you like about this project?
Managed to copy and solve most errors in most pages, while trying to figure out different function
copied the javascript and css accordingly, altering values. 

## What did you struggle with in this project?
Alot of errors came from database mainly the naming convention,
I was not able render out the values as there are errors which i am not able to catch,
error 500 unable to render the data out. 


## What would make your experience with this assessment better?
Springboot is really hard, if you could stretch this abit longer to explain in detail 
it would be better.
